# web-gui-snippets

This is a random collection of code and web gadgets that I have developed while working on ACMACS GUI (2011 .. 2014). The part of the project I worked on went nowhere, as far as I can tell, but some of its elements were good enough to be salvaged and reused elsewhere. I will attempt to extract (and abstract) as much as I can.

The original code is based on YUI, which is also dead now, but it is still available to run example code.
